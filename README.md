Features
•	AI Integration: Easily integrate AI capabilities into your application.
•	Micro-App Structure: Pre-defined structure for creating modular, manageable micro-applications.
•	Scalable Deployment: Configuration for Render and other deployment tools.

Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	Render (for containerized deployment)
•	Required Python libraries specified in requirements.txt

Installation
1.	Clone the Repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd AI_MicroApp_Template_Development
2.	Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the application locally, execute:
python main.py

Deployment on Render
1.	Create a Render Account
Sign up at Render.com and log in to your dashboard.
2.	Connect Git Repository
o	Ensure your project is in a Git repository. Push it to a version control platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket if it’s not already hosted online.
o	In Render, go to the Dashboard, select New > Web Service.
o	Connect Render to your Git repository and select the repository containing this project.
3.	Configure the Render Service
After connecting to your repository, Render will prompt you to configure the service.
o	Name: Enter a name for your service.
o	Region: Select your preferred region.
o	Branch: Choose the branch (e.g., main) you want to deploy.
o	Build Command: Render automatically detects your Dockerfile, so no specific build command is needed if you’re using Docker. If you are not using Docker, use:
pip install -r requirements.txt
o	Start Command: Specify how to start the application. If your main file is app.py, use:
python main.py
4.	Environment Variables (Optional)
If your application requires any environment variables (such as API keys or secret tokens), you can add them in the Environment tab within Render’s service configuration. Make sure to keep sensitive data secure.
5.	Deploy
Click on Create Web Service. Render will automatically start building and deploying your application. Once deployed, Render will provide a public URL for accessing your application.
6.	Verify Deployment
Visit the URL provided by Render to ensure your application is running as expected. You can monitor logs in the Render dashboard to troubleshoot any deployment issues.
